Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects demonstrating various data analysis and model-building techniques, under the instructions and guidance of Elevvo internship

Student Score Prediction
This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict student exam scores. The model uses study hours and other student performance factors as input.

Key Findings
A positive linear relationship was observed between study hours and exam scores.

The trained model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 12.35 and an R-squared score of 0.21 on the test set, suggesting that study hours alone are not a strong predictor of exam scores.

The project also details the process of handling missing values and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Movie Recommendation System
This project outlines the creation of a movie recommendation system using a user-item matrix and cosine similarity. The goal is to recommend top-rated, unseen movies to users.

Key Findings
The system was evaluated using Precision@K (with K=5), achieving an average Precision@5 of 0.0016, which suggests the current user-similarity approach may not be highly effective for this dataset.

The notebook recommends exploring alternative algorithms, such as item-based collaborative filtering or matrix factorization, to improve performance.

Music Genre Classification
This project involves classifying songs into different genres based on their extracted audio features. A RandomForestClassifier model was trained for this multi-class classification task.

Key Findings
The RandomForestClassifier model was trained and evaluated.

The notebook includes a classification report showing precision, recall, and f1-scores for each genre, which can be analyzed to identify areas for model improvement.

Traffic Sign Recognition
This project attempts to build a deep learning model to classify traffic signs from images. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and preprocesses images for classification.

Key Findings
The data loading and preprocessing steps failed due to a FileNotFoundError, as the specified image files were not found.

The notebook concludes that the next step is to ensure the image files are correctly uploaded and accessible within the environment to proceed with the project.
